<div class="body"><p>There are three main areas to which our funds are directed:  Technology Program; Building Facilities/Grounds and Classroom Materials; and Professional Development/Student Programs.  For several years, the Foundation has held an annual auction that has successfully raised funds to support our various goals.  In 2011, the Foundation will hold a different type of fundraiser with the same purpose of raising funds to benefit the students, staff and entire Carderock Springs ES community.</p></div>
<div class="title">Technology Program </div>
<div class="body"><p>
The Foundation raises money annually to support the CSES Technology Program, which includes specialized computer instruction for the children via before and after school workshops, and curriculum development and training for the teachers. The first-ever Carderock computer lab was equipped through Foundation funds, and it has been a priority ever since. Most recently, the Foundation purchased two racks of netbook computers (12 computers on a cart) to enrich both classroom and media center instruction. In 2011 the Foundation plans to purchase two additional racks to further enhance the learning opportunities for Carderock students.  With the netbooks, teachers can develop dynamic lessons using the internet or educational software, and employ interactive techniques with students. The Technology Program is an important part of CSES, receiving rave reviews from Principal Palmisano, the teachers, and the students. Our ability to offer this advanced computer and technology support is solely due to the efforts and funds raised by the Foundation.</p>
</div>
<div class="title">Building Facilities/Grounds and Classroom Materials</div>
<div class="body">
<p>Long before the new school was built, CSES needed occasional upgrades and renovations to existing equipment and facilities.  For instance, several years ago, the Foundation funded a much needed bathroom renovation at Carderock.   As plans for the new school building developed, the Foundation became an instrumental player in the strategy and planning phases.  </p>
<p>Through several years of open planning meetings with volunteers, parents, MCPS, community members, and faculty at Carderock, a wish list of ideas and project enhancements was developed for consideration in the new school.  Many of the items on the original list -- including smart boards, wireless internet, telephones in classrooms, a covered canopy from the bus loop to the school entrance, student storage cubbies and lockers, upgrades to the multi-purpose room, and an upgraded front stair to the school -- were accomplished through the Foundation's interactions with MCPS, its architect and construction subcontractor team, at no cost to the Foundation, a savings of over $500,000 to our community by several estimates.</p>
<p>It is important to note that MCPS must review and approve renovation requests to ensure that contributions from the Foundation will not provide CSES students with a competitive advantage over children at other MCPS schools.  After additional briefings with MCPS representatives and the Board of Education, several other items that the Foundation was seeking for the new school were approved, and were installed with the Foundation's involvement.  These upgrades cost approximately $180,000, and were completely funded through several years of donations, auctions and amazing support from the CSES community.  The additional upgrades include the following:</p>
<div class="subtitle">Habitat Garden</div>
<p>
The new habitat garden features seating as part of a retaining wall that can accommodate at least one classroom. Teachers can use this space as an outdoor classroom to learn about plants and other science-related topics.  The Habitat garden is a work in progress, still needing landscaping, benches and plantings to truly make it an outdoor classroom.
</p>
<div class="subtitle">Amphitheater</div>
<p>
With the fairly steep slope behind the school, an amphitheater was a natural fit and a long-standing request from parents, teachers, and the community. The standard amphitheater that the school system provides consists of railroad ties and mulch. The Foundation paid for a long-lasting amphitheater made out of concrete, with alternating Carderock stone risers. A sun study indicates that by early spring the amphitheater will get plenty of sun to keep it dry and attractive for teachers and students alike to use. The seating capacity is quite large, supporting the seating of two full grades. The amphitheater provides a solution to the grading of the hill and a resource for the entire community.
</p>
<div class="subtitle">Electronic Bulletin Boards </div>
<p>
The Foundation purchased and installed two LCD screens -- one for the entryway upstairs and one for the vestibule downstairs.  These screens enable the school PTA and administration to communicate important information to staff, students, and parents, while enhancing school spirit.  Students will be able to help design slides to run on the screens, which will be integrated into the school's computer system.  The Foundation purchased the screens separately to save on markup costs and the builders wired the locations for the two screens.
</p>
<div class="subtitle">Basketball Backboards </div>
<p>
Two glass rectangular backboards were installed at the basketball hoops at either end of the gym, replacing the smaller, fan-shaped aluminum backboards that would have normally been installed as part of the standard MCPS design.
</p>
<div class="subtitle">Upgraded Carderock School Sign </div>
<p>
The Foundation was able to fund an upgraded school sign for the front of the building, which was precast and faced in indigenous Carderock stone.  It is viewable approaching the school from either direction and adds to the uniqueness of the building. 
</p>
<div class="subtitle">Terrazzo Tile Flooring in Lobby </div>
<p>
Terrazzo tile was installed as the flooring in the main level lobby area.  In addition to the aesthetic advantages it provides as you enter the school, it also adds durability to a high-traffic area, and will reduce long-term maintenance and replacement costs, freeing up future CSES school funds for educational purposes. 
</p>
<div class="subtitle">Stone Base Around Front Columns of School </div>
<p>
With the Foundation's support, the architect, Beery Rio, designed columns outside the front of the school that have indigenous Carderock stone bases.
</p>
<div class="subtitle">Classroom Materials</div>
<p>
The 2009 auction raised over $40,000 for new science equipment for the school.  Principal Palmisano and the CSES teachers are currently selecting equipment and materials that will correlate with the MCPS curriculum for all grade levels. </p>
<p>
We are very proud of the enhancements the Foundation was able to provide to the new CSES school building and community.  However, we also realize that there will be additional upgrades and items needed over the next several years.  We plan to continue fundraising to support these ongoing and future projects, which may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Educational equipment and materials</li> 
<li>Multipurpose room upgrades, including an upgraded sound system and a high-definition digital projector, speakers and equipment that can be linked to the school's computer system </li>
<li>Media-center upgrades </li>
<li>Field reseeding and/or leveling </li>
<li>Additional playground equipment and upgrades  </li>
<li>Plants for habitat garden and other areas of the grounds </li>
<li>Landscaping and aesthetic improvements to outdoor spaces</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that these are just some of the ideas that are up for consideration, pending funding and approval.  All input and ideas from the CSES community are welcome!</p>
</div>
<div class="title">Professional Development/Student Programs</div>
<div class="body">
<p>A new area of focus for the Foundation is the betterment of our teachers, staff and students, through professional development and school programs designed to enhance the instruction, learning environment and school climate at Carderock Springs ES.  Ideas are currently being discussed and will likely begin implementation during the 2011-2012 school year.</p> 
</div>
<div class="title">
Summary
</div>
<div class="body">
<p>The CSES Educational Foundation will continue to work closely with MCPS, Principal Palmisano, teachers and staff to help fund gaps and suggest enhancements for our school, both for today and as a legacy for the future. The financial support and involvement of the CSES community is integral to the attainment of our goals. Due to generous donations and dedication to our mission to-date, what was already recognized as one of the best elementary schools in the country is now even better. The County has given our children and teachers a fantastic new school; we will continue to give back and make it even better.</p>
