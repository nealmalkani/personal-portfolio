    <div class="testimonialText"><p>Neal has been an extremely dependable, diligent and accommodating professional and it has been a pleasure to work with him. He has always been there when I needed his services even at short notice and kept with my requirements until the job was completed to my satisfaction. He has also been very calm and pleasant, qualities that mean a lot in situations with tight deadlines. I would recommend him highly for any job with which he is entrusted as he will go that extra mile to ensure it is not just done, but done well.</p></div>

    <div class="testimonialText"><p>During his 5-year internship with Ibhana, I have seen Neal develop talents and strengths from being just an intern, to becoming a valuable team player at Ibhana. Neal's strengths, which contribute to his success in his every endeavor, are: his excellent organizational skills (often rare in a young student), which help him multi-task and participate in a variety of activities over and above his academic program. He is dependable and can be counted on for a job being delivered in a timely manner. I have watched as Neal has developed strong skills at communication and persuasion and become an important member of Ibhana's web team, often taking a leading role in making recommendations and executing tasks assigned to him.</p></div>

    <div class="testimonialText"><p>Neal was instrumental in quickly getting a workable internet site up and running for the CSES Educational Foundation. Before Neal came on board to help, the Foundation did not have much of a presence within the school community. Neal understood our objectives and made the monumental task of redesigning and configuring the website look easy. He knew how to seamlessly integrate the Foundation's site with the school's PTA website, making our message stronger as a result. Neal's work still remains the backbone of the structural and aesthetic design of our website today. In addition to having an incredible knowledge base and skill set for the website redesign, Neal was extremely pleasant to work with and consistently surpassed our expectations.</p></div>

    <div class="testimonialText"><p>I had the pleasure of meeting Neal Malkani in 2010 when he agreed to help our PTA at Carderock Springs Elementary School. We were in need of a new design for our website, and Neal agreed to take on the challenge and started from scratch. He met with me twice as we identified our specific needs and he offered creative and practical advice on how to make it user friendly, incorporate all of the data and information we wanted to include, introduced our new logo and even came up with some new artwork. Neal made the whole process painless for our leadership, and worked very hard to get our new site live prior to the beginning of the new school year. He was not paid, but rather did the work on his own time, earning community service hours. He exceeded all of our expectations! We couldn't have done it without him and the site continues to serve our organization and our community.</p></div>

    <div class="testimonialText"><p>Neal made the whole process of designing a website for me seamless and easy. I am not at all tech-savvy, but this did not matter. He anticipated my needs, answered questions, made himself available, and was incredibly patient through the whole process. Best of all, the end product reflected what I wanted from the website. He has a great understanding of what it takes to design user-friendly websites, and in my view he is an excellent choice for anyone that needs this kind of work. He has a keen sense of responsibility and purpose that make him see a job through to a successful conclusion.</p></div>
