Sunita has the rare skill of knowing how to structure ideas so that your interests jump off the page.  She was very collaborative throughout the whole process, and brainstorming with her about my essay topics and the best way to present an idea was enormously helpful.  She was an invaluable resource throughout the application process and with the insights she provided I gained admission into my school of choice.  I am certain that she can be equally helpful to other students.</em></span></td>

She brings that same talent and clarity of thought to her own writing, which is graceful, elegant, and persuasive. I would not dream of submitting a proposal, an essay, or an article for publication without first subjecting it to her exacting review.</span></td>
